Let me provide a detailed overview:\n\n## Current Tools Architecture Overview\n\nBased on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive overview of the current tools architecture in the codin project:\n\n### **Core Architecture Components**\n\n#### **1. Tool Base Classes (`/src/codin/tool/base.py`)**\n- **`Tool`**: Abstract base class for all tools\n  - Inherits from `LifecycleMixin` for lifecycle management (`up()`/`down()`)\n  - Has `name`, `description`, `version`, `input_schema` (Pydantic model)\n  - Abstract `run()` method that takes args and `ToolContext`\n  - Supports both regular and generative (streaming) tools\n  - Provides schema conversion methods: `to_tool_definition()`, `to_mcp_schema()`, `to_openai_schema()`\n\n- **`Toolset`**: Collection of logically related tools\n  - Manages multiple tools with lifecycle coordination\n  - Provides unified schema conversion for all contained tools\n  - Supports tool lookup by name\n\n- **`ToolContext`**: Execution context for tools\n  - Contains `tool_name`, `arguments`, `session_id`, `fileids`, `tool_call_id`, `metadata`\n\n- **`ToolDefinition`**: Immutable tool definition for LLM function calling\n  - Contains `name`, `description`, `parameters` (JSON schema), `metadata`\n\n#### **2. Tool Registry (`/src/codin/tool/registry.py`)**\n- **`ToolRegistry`**: Central registry for tool management\n  - Supports loading from filesystem (`fs://`), HTTP endpoints (`http://`)\n  - Handles tool name resolution and conflict detection\n  - Supports prefix removal for simplified tool names (e.g., `sandbox_read_file` → `read_file`)\n  - Automatic tool discovery from Python modules using `get_tools()` / `get_toolsets()` functions\n  - Registry lifecycle management with `up()` / `down()`\n\n- **`ToolEndpoint`**: Configuration for tool endpoints\n  - Supports filesystem, HTTP, and other protocols\n  - Authentication configuration support\n\n#### **3. Tool Executor (`/src/codin/tool/executor.py`)**\n- **`ToolExecutor`**: Execution engine with cross-cutting concerns\n  - Concurrency control with semaphores\n  - Retry logic with configurable attempts\n  - Hook system for before/after execution and error handling\n  - Comprehensive metrics (OpenTelemetry + Prometheus)\n  - Support for both regular and async generator tools\n  - Input validation using tool schemas\n  - Protocol type conversion (MCP → agent protocol types)\n\n- **`ApprovalHook`**: Built-in hook for tool approval workflows\n  - Supports `ALWAYS`, `NEVER`, `UNSAFE_ONLY` approval modes\n  - Safety checks for potentially dangerous tools\n\n#### **4. Tool Types**\n\n##### **Sandbox Tools (`/src/codin/tool/sandbox_tools.py`)**\n- **`SandboxTool`**: Base class for sandbox-integrated tools\n- **`SandboxMethodTool`**: Auto-generated from sandbox methods with `tool_` prefix\n- **`SandboxToolset`**: Auto-discovers and wraps all sandbox tool methods\n\n**Key sandbox tools include:**\n- `tool_read_file`: File reading with line range support\n- `tool_edit_file`: File editing and creation\n- `tool_run_shell`: Shell command execution\n- `tool_list_dir`: Directory listing\n- `tool_grep_search`: Fast regex search using ripgrep\n- `tool_codebase_search`: Semantic code search\n- `tool_file_search`: Fuzzy file path search\n- `tool_search_replace`: Find and replace in files\n- `tool_delete_file`: File deletion\n- `tool_web_search`: Web search (placeholder)\n- `tool_fetch`: URL fetching and content extraction\n\n##### **MCP Tools (`/src/codin/tool/mcp/`)**\n- **`MCPTool`**: Wraps individual MCP server tools\n- **`MCPToolset`**: Manages collections of MCP tools from a server\n- **`MCPSessionManager`**: Handles MCP server connections (HTTP, stdio, SSE)\n- Support for standard MCP methods and custom tool calls\n- Automatic schema conversion between MCP and codin formats\n- Connection management with retry logic and error handling\n\n##### **Generic Tools (`/src/codin/tool/generic.py`)**\n- **`GenericTool`**: Delegates to `ToolExecutor` with additional features\n- **`create_tool_from_function()`**: Creates tools from Python functions\n- Auto-generates Pydantic schemas from function signatures\n- Supports both sync and async functions\n\n#### **5. Integration Points**\n\n##### **Sandbox Integration (`/src/codin/sandbox/base.py`)**\n- **`Sandbox`** base class provides `get_tool_methods()` for tool discovery\n- Auto-discovery of methods with `tool_` prefix\n- Each sandbox implementation (local, Docker, cloud) can expose different tools\n\n##### **Agent Integration (`/src/codin/agent/code_agent.py`)**\n- **`CodeAgent`** uses `ToolRegistry` and `ToolExecutor`\n- Tool execution in `_execute_tool_call()` method\n- Integration with approval workflows and event emission\n- Tool call parsing from LLM responses (multiple formats supported)\n\n##### **Configuration Support**\n- YAML/JSON configuration files for registry setup\n- Endpoint configuration with authentication\n- Environment policies for sandbox tools\n\n### **Key Architectural Patterns**\n\n1. **Plugin Architecture**: Tools can be loaded from filesystem, HTTP endpoints, or programmatically\n2. **Lifecycle Management**: All components support `up()`/`down()` for proper resource management\n3. **Schema Flexibility**: Multiple schema formats (OpenAI, MCP, internal) with automatic conversion\n4. **Execution Safety**: Approval workflows, timeout management, retry logic\n5. **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and event emission\n6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tool types, sandbox backends, or execution hooks\n\n### **Current Tool Discovery Mechanisms**\n\n1. **Filesystem**: Python modules with `get_tools()` / `get_toolsets()` functions\n2. **Sandbox Methods**: Auto-discovery of `tool_*` methods in sandbox classes\n3. **MCP Servers**: Dynamic discovery from connected MCP servers\n4. **Programmatic**: Direct registration via `registry.register_tool()`\n\nThis architecture provides a robust, extensible foundation for tool management with support for multiple tool types, execution environments, and integration patterns.\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."}],"system":[{"type":"text","text":"Summarize this coding conversation in under 50 characters.\nCapture the main task, key files, problems addressed, and current status.","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}],"temperature":0,"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1749904201.624,"status_code":403,"headers":{"cf-ray":"94f9d6200e8d7d5e-LAX","connection":"keep-alive","content-encoding":"gzip","content-type":"application/json","date":"Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:29:59 GMT","server":"cloudflare","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-robots-tag":"none"},"body":{"error":{"type":"forbidden","message":"Request not allowed"}}},"logged_at":"2025-06-14T12:30:01.624Z"}

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following: \n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\nWhen the user directly asks about Claude Code (eg 'can Claude Code do...', 'does Claude Code have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from Claude Code docs at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code.\n  - The available sub-pages are `overview`, `cli-usage` (CLI commands, CLI flags, SDK, slash commands, and modes), `memory` (Memory management and CLAUDE.md), `settings`, `security` (Permissions and tools), `costs`, `bedrock-vertex-proxies` (Model configuration, /model, --model, ANTHROPIC_MODEL), `tutorials` (Extended thinking, pasting images, and common workflows), `troubleshooting`\n  - Example: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage\n\n# Tone and style\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: write tests for new feature\nassistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\nFor example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\nfalse\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CLAUDE.md so that you will know to run it next time.\nNEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nYou MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /home/jucheng/work/my/codin\nIs directory a git repo: Yes\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2\nToday's date: 6/14/2025\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4. The exact model ID is claude-sonnet-4-20250514.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\ngitStatus: This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.\nCurrent branch: main\n\nMain branch (you will usually use this for PRs): main\n\nStatus:\n?? .claude-bridge/\n\nRecent commits:\n76d9188 Merge pull request #70 from wolvever/codex/complete-r-a-p-trinity-agent-package-implementation\n11e3ba6 feat(agent): add R-A-P Trinity components\n287da2c Merge pull request #69 from wolvever/fix/initial-code-stabilization\n987615b Fix: Initial codebase stabilization and circular dependency resolution\n23fa7c6 Merge pull request #67 from wolvever/codex/update-documents-for-readability","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}],"tools":[{"name":"Task","description":"Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, exit_plan_mode, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoRead, TodoWrite, WebSearch.

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` (or master...HEAD) to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"priority":{"type":"string","enum":["high","medium","low"]},"id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"The updated todo list"}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","minLength":2,"description":"The search query to use"},"allowed_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Only include search results from these domains"},"blocked_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Never include search results from these domains"}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}],"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"max_tokens":32000,"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1749904207.352,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-request-id":"req_1749904207350_0r743m2tr","cache-control":"no-cache","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"text/event-stream"},"body_raw":"event: message_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_start\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"msg_1749904207349_ca8w5xwge\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\"content\":[],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":13565,\"output_tokens\":0}}}\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":0,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"I'll analyze the current tools implementation to u\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"nderstand the codebase structure and plan a refact\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"or that separates tool descriptions/schemas from t\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"ool execution.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following: \n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\nWhen the user directly asks about Claude Code (eg 'can Claude Code do...', 'does Claude Code have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from Claude Code docs at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code.\n  - The available sub-pages are `overview`, `cli-usage` (CLI commands, CLI flags, SDK, slash commands, and modes), `memory` (Memory management and CLAUDE.md), `settings`, `security` (Permissions and tools), `costs`, `bedrock-vertex-proxies` (Model configuration, /model, --model, ANTHROPIC_MODEL), `tutorials` (Extended thinking, pasting images, and common workflows), `troubleshooting`\n  - Example: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage\n\n# Tone and style\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\".

You should strive to strike a balance between:\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\nFor example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\nfalse\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CLAUDE.md so that you will know to run it next time.\nNEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nYou MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /home/jucheng/work/my/codin\nIs directory a git repo: Yes\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2\nToday's date: 6/14/2025\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4. The exact model ID is claude-sonnet-4-20250514.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\ngitStatus: This is the git status at the start of the conversation.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` (or master...HEAD) to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"priority":{"type":"string","enum":["high","medium","low"]},"id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"The updated todo list"}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","minLength":2,"description":"The search query to use"},"allowed_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Only include search results from these domains"},"blocked_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Never include search results from these domains"}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}],"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"max_tokens":32000,"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1749904214.528,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-request-id":"req_1749904214527_6n856r440","cache-control":"no-cache","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"text/event-stream"},"body_raw":"event: message_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_start\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"msg_1749904214527_84arj312d\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\"content\":[],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":14000,\"output_tokens\":0}}}\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":0,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"id\":\"toolu_vrtx_01CHvieGDSUXj36UjzVRgKVS\",\"name\":\"Task\",\"input\":{}}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"input_json_delta\",\"partial_json\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Find tools implementation files\\\",\\\"\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"input_json_delta\",\"partial_json\":\"prompt\\\":\\\"Search through the codebase to find files\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"input_json_delta\",\"partial_json\":\" related to tools implementation.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` (or master...HEAD) to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"timeout":{"type":"number","description":"Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)"},"description":{"type":"string","description":" Clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.

Verify the directory path is correct\n\nTo make multiple file edits, provide the following:\n1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)\n2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:\n   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)\n   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string\n   - replace_all: Replace all occurences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided\n- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit\n- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied\n- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file\n- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEdit instead\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool\n2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied\n3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations\n\nWARNING:\n- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)\n- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same\n- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find\n\nWhen making edits:\n- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code\n- Do not leave the code in a broken state\n- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"priority":{"type":"string","enum":["high","medium","low"]},"id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"The updated todo list"}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","minLength":2,"description":"The search query to use"},"allowed_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Only include search results from these domains"},"blocked_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Never include search results from these domains"}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}],"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"max_tokens":32000,"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1749904218.346,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-request-id":"req_1749904218345_306nt2wym","cache-control":"no-cache","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"text/event-stream"},"body_raw":"event: message_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_start\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"msg_1749904218345_ojf9vui02\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\"content\":[],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":10133,\"output_tokens\":0}}}\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":0,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"I'll search through the codebase to find all files\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" related to tools implementation.

The exact model ID is claude-sonnet-4-20250514.\n\ngitStatus: This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.\nCurrent branch: main\n\nMain branch (you will usually use this for PRs): main\n\nStatus:\n?? .claude-bridge/\n\nRecent commits:\n76d9188 Merge pull request #70 from wolvever/codex/complete-r-a-p-trinity-agent-package-implementation\n11e3ba6 feat(agent): add R-A-P Trinity components\n287da2c Merge pull request #69 from wolvever/fix/initial-code-stabilization\n987615b Fix: Initial codebase stabilization and circular dependency resolution\n23fa7c6 Merge pull request #67 from wolvever/codex/update-documents-for-readability","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}],"tools":[{"name":"Bash","description":"Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` (or master...HEAD) to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"priority":{"type":"string","enum":["high","medium","low"]},"id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"The updated todo list"}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","minLength":2,"description":"The search query to use"},"allowed_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Only include search results from these domains"},"blocked_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Never include search results from these domains"}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}],"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"max_tokens":32000,"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1749904221.726,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-request-id":"req_1749904221725_pere0m9oq","cache-control":"no-cache","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"text/event-stream"},"body_raw":"event: message_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_start\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"msg_1749904221725_odvus8nlm\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\"content\":[],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":13815,\"output_tokens\":0}}}\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":0,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"Now let me search for tool-related files more spec\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"ifically using glob patterns:\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_stop\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_stop\",\"index\":0}\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":1,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"id\":\"toolu_vrtx_011cJUY3fQxBBcjJqxX96rdP\",\"name\":\"Glob\",\"input\":{}}}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":1,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"input_json_delta\",\"partial_json\":\"{\\\"pattern\\\":\\\"**/*tool*\\\"}\"}}\n\nevent: content_block_stop\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_stop\",\"index\":1}\n\nevent: message_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_delta\",\"delta\":{\"stop_reason\":\"tool_use\",\"stop_sequence\":null},\"usage\":{\"output_tokens\":71}}\n\nevent: message_stop\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_stop\"}\n\n"},"logged_at":"2025-06-14T12:30:21.726Z"}

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` (or master...HEAD) to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"timeout":{"type":"number","description":"Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)"},"description":{"type":"string","description":" Clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"priority":{"type":"string","enum":["high","medium","low"]},"id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"The updated todo list"}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","minLength":2,"description":"The search query to use"},"allowed_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Only include search results from these domains"},"blocked_domains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"Never include search results from these domains"}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}],"metadata":{"user_id":"7e5d4951b1f4a9a059810adfa22baab9c2236a978ad3fdba44f34bf0fba5e20d"},"max_tokens":32000,"stream":true}},"response":null,"note":"ORPHANED_REQUEST","logged_at":"2025-06-14T12:30:25.217Z"}
